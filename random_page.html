       <a href = “ https://www.apple.com/”>Apple Inc. (formerly Apple Computer, Inc.) </a> is an American multinational technology company headquartered in <a href= "https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cupertino,+CA,+USA/@37.3093111,-122.0848441,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fb4571bd377ab:0x394d3fe1a3e178b4!8m2!3d37.3229978!4d-122.0321823!16zL20vMHI2Nzk?hl=en&entry=ttu">Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley.</a>It designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. Devices include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV; operating systems include iOS and macOS; and software applications and services include iTunes, iCloud, and Apple Music.

As of March 2023, Apple was the world's largest company by market capitalization,[6] but it lost this position to Microsoft in January 2024.[7] In 2022, it was the largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.3 billion.[8] As of June 2022, Apple was the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales, the largest manufacturing company by revenue, and the second-largest manufacturer of mobile phones in the world. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), and Microsoft.

Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and market Steve Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company's internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as "Wintel").

In 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs's return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the "Think different" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.

Apple has received criticism regarding its contractors' labor practices, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, it has a large following and a high level of brand loyalty. It has been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.

Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3 trillion.[9]

       <strong> 1976–1980: Founding and incorporation </strong> 
       <div>
Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by<a href=  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs"> Steve Jobs </a>, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[10][13] The company's first product is the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[14] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[15]: 57  Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $6,700 in 2022). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[16] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which was not yet marketed as a complete personal computer.[17] It was priced soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,400 in 2022).[18][19]: 180  Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".[20]

Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[21][22] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.[23] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,207,000 in 2022) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[24] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[25]

The Apple II, also designed by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[26] It differs from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. The Apple I and early Apple II models use ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, which were superseded by the 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[27][28]

The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "killer application" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[27] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[27] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[29][30]

On December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol "AAPL") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3, 2022),[22] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[31] By the end of the day, 300 millionaires were created, including Jobs and Wozniak, from a stock price of $29 per share[32] and a market cap of $1.778 billion.[31][32]

       <strong>Mac</strong>
       
       <div>
         Macintosh, commonly known as Mac, is Apple's line of personal computers that use the company's proprietary macOS operating system. Personal computers were Apple's original business line, but as of the end of 2023 they account for only about eight percent of the company's revenue.[1]

There are six Macintosh computer families in production:

iMac: Consumer all-in-one desktop computer, introduced in 1998.
Mac Mini: Consumer sub-desktop computer, introduced in 2005.
MacBook Pro: Professional notebook, introduced in 2006.
Mac Pro: Professional workstation, introduced in 2006.
MacBook Air: Consumer ultra-thin notebook, introduced in 2008.
Mac Studio: Professional small form-factor workstation, introduced in 2022.
Often described as a walled garden, Macs use Apple silicon chips, run the macOS operating system, and include Apple software like the Safari web browser, iMovie for home movie editing, GarageBand for music creation, and the iWork productivity suite. Apple also sells pro apps: Final Cut Pro for video production, Logic Pro for musicians and producers, and Xcode for software developers.

Apple also sells a variety of accessories for Macs, including the Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard.

    The iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new models have been released every year. When it was introduced, its multi-touch screen was described as "revolutionary" and a "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry. The device has been credited with creating the app economy.

    iOS is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android. The iPhone has generated large profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.[184] As of the end of 2023, the iPhone accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.[1]
