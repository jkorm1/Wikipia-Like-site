# Wikipia-Like-site
In this project, we set out to create a Wikipedia-like front end to demonstrate our proficiency in HTML and CSS. Our aim is not only to provide a functional platform with features such as an entry page, edit page, and random page, but also to showcase the aesthetics and responsiveness achieved through our HTML and CSS implementation.
